Data flow hardware description language

The name Floha stands for "data FLOw HArdware", or "data FLOw HAskell", whatever suits you better.

It is similar to CAPH data flow hardware language: http://wwwlasmea.univ-bpclermont.fr/Personnel/Jocelyn.Serot/caph.html

I hope to fix some deficiencies in CAPH.
